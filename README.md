# Email Suffix generator

Our email generator uses the Gmail aliases feature to produce countless email addresses, all directed to a single inbox. This enables the creation of multiple accounts for a service, with all traffic directed to one inbox, facilitating mass account creation. However, it's important to note that a few websites may not accept these types of email addresses. Please refer to the table below for more details.

WARNING⚠️: This isn't a Google account generator.
